            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was neuer any thing by the wit of man ſo well deuiſed, or ſo ſure eſtabliſhed, which in continuance of time hath not bin corrupted: as among other things, it may plainly appeare by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers in the Church, commonly called Diuine Seruice. The firſt originall and ground whereof, if a man woulde ſearch out by the ancient Fathers, hee ſhall find that the ſame was not ordained but of a good purpoſe, and for a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of godlineſſe. For they ſoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greateſt part thereof) ſhould be read ouer once euery yeere, entending thereby that the Clergie, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as were miniſters of the Congregation, ſhould (by often reading and meditation of Gods word) be ſtirred vp to godlineſſe themſelues, and be more able to exhort other by wholeſome doctrine, and to confute them that were aduerſarics to the trueth. And further, that the people (by dayly hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) ſhould continually profite more &amp; more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inſlamed with the loue of his true religion. But theſe many yeres paſſed, this godly and decent order of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers hath bene ſo altered, broken, &amp; neglected, by planting in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtories, Legends, Reſponds, Verſes, vaine Repetitions, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorations, and Synodalles, that commonly when any booke of the Bible was begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three or foure chapters were read out, all the reſt were vnread. And in this ſort the booke of Eſay was begun in Aduent, and the booke of Geneſis in Septuageſima: but they were onely begun, and neuer read through. After like ſort were other bookes of holy Scripture vſed. And moreouer, whereas Saint Paul would haue ſuch language ſpoken to the people in the Church, as they might vnderſtand, and haue profit by hearing the ſame: the ſeruice in this Church of England, theſe many yeres, hath bin read in Latine to the people, which they vnderſtood not: ſo that they haue heard with their cares only, and their heart, ſpirit, and mind haue not bene edif;ied thereby. And furthermore, not with ſlanding that the ancient Fathers haue deuided the Pſalmes into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen portions, wherof euery one was called a Nocturne: now of late time a few of them haue bene dayly ſayd, and oft repeated, and the reſt vtterly omitted. Moreouer, the number and hardneſſe of the rules called the Pie, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſold changings of the ſeruice, was the cauſe, that to turne the booke onely was ſo hard and intricate a matter, that many times there was more buſineſſe to find out what ſhould be read, then to reade it when it was found out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1545:6"/>Theſe in conueniences therefore conſidered, here is ſet foorth ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where by the ſame ſhall be redreſſed. And for a readineſſe in this matter hereis drawen out a Kalender for that purpoſe, which is plaine and eaſie to be vnderſtanded, wherein (ſo much as may bee) the reading of holy Scriptures is ſo ſet forth, that all things ſhalbe done in order, without breaking one piece there of from an other. For this cauſe be cut off Anthemes, Reſponds, Inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and ſuch like things, as did breake the continuall courſe of the reading of the Scripture. Yet becauſe there is no remedie, but that of neceſſitie there muſt bee ſome rules, therefore certaine rules are here ſet foorth, which as they bee ſewe in number, ſo they be plaine and eaſie to be vnderſtanded. So that here you haue an order for prayer (as touching the reading of holy Scripture) much agreeable to the mind and purpoſe of the olde fathers, and a great deale more profitable and commodious then that which of late was vſed. It is more profitable, becauſe here are left out many things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome be vntrue ſome vncertaine, ſome vaine and ſuperſtitious, and is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined nothing to be read, but the very pure word of God, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or that which is euidently grounded vpon the ſame, and that in ſuch a language and order, as is moſt eaſie and plaine for the vnderſtanding both of the readers and hearers. It is alſo more commodious, both for the ſhortneſſe thereof, and for the plainneſſe of the order, and for that the rules be fewe and caſie. Furthermore by this order the Curates ſhall neede none other bookes for their publike ſeruice, but this booke and the Bible. By the meanes wherof, the people ſhall not bee at ſo great charges for bookes, as in times paſt they haue bene.</p>
                  <p>And where here to fore there hath bene great diuerſitie in ſaying &amp; ſinging in Churches within this Realme, ſome following Salisbury vſe, ſome Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford vſe, and ſomc the vſe of Bangor, ſome of Yorke, ſome of Lincolne: Now from henceforth all the whole Realme ſhall haue but one vſe. And if any will iudge this way more painefull, becauſe that all things muſt be read vpon the booke, where as before, by the reaſon of ſo often repetition they could ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things by heart: if thoſe men will weigh their labour, with the proſire and knowledge which dayly they ſhall obtaine by reading vpon the booke, they will not refuſe the payne, in conſideration of the great profite that ſhall enſue thereof.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as nothing can almoſt be ſo plainely ſet forth, but doubts mary life in the vſe and practiſing of the ſame. To appeaſe all ſuch diuerſity (if any ariſe) and for the reſolution of all doubts concerning the maner how to vnderſtand do, and execute the things contained in this Booke: The parties that ſo doubt, or diuerſly take any thing, ſhall alway reſort to the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, who by his diſeretion ſhall rake order for the quieting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of the ſame, ſo that the ſame order be not contrary to any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this booke. And if the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe be in any doubt, then he may ſend for the reſolution thereof vnto the Archbiſhop.</p>
                  <p>Though it be appointed in the afore written Preſace, that all things ſhall beread and ſung in the Church in the Engliſh tongue, to the ende that the Congregation may be thereby ediſied: yet it is not meant, but when men ſay
<pb facs="tcp:1545:6"/>
Morning &amp; Euening prayer priuately, they may ſay the ſame in any language that they themſelues doe vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p>And all Prieſts and Deacons ſhall be bound to ſay dayly the Morning and Euening prayer, either priuately or openly, except they be let by preaching, ſtudying of diuinity, or by ſome other vrgent cauſe.</p>
                  <p>And the Curate that miniſtreth in euery pariſh Church or Chappel being at home, and not being otherwiſe reaſonably letted, ſhall ſay the ſame in the Pariſh Church or Chappell where he miniſtreth, and ſhall toll a bell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, a conuenient time before he begin, that ſuch as be diſpoſed, may come to heare Gods word, and to pray with him.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>f ſuch Ceremonieſ as be vſed in the Church, and haue had their beginning by the inſſitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man: ſome at the firſt were of godly intent &amp; purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, and yet at length turned to vanity &amp; ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſome entred into the Church by vndiſcreet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion &amp; ſuch a zeale as was without knowledge, and for becauſe they were winked at in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they grew dayly to more and more abuſes, which not only for their vnprofitablenes, but alſo becauſe they haue much blinded the people, and obſcured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut a way, and cleane reiected. Other there be, which although they haue been deuiſed by man, yet it is thought good to reſerue them ſtill, aſ well for &amp; decent order in the Church (for the which they were firſt deuiſed) as becauſe they pertaine to edification, whereunto all things done in the Church (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ought to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony, in it ſelfe conſidered, is but a ſmall thing: yet the wilfull and contemptuous tranſgreſſion, and breaking of a common order and diſcipline, is no ſmall offence before God.</p>
                  <p>Let all things be done among you, faith S. Paul, in a ſeemely and due order. The appointment of the which order, pertaineth not to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men: therfore no man ought to take in hand, nor preſume to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or alter any publike or common order in Chriſts Church, except he be lawfully called and authoriſed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And where as in this our time, the minds of men are ſo diuers, that ſome thinke it &amp; great matter of conſcience to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a piece of the leaſt of their ceremonies, they be ſo addicted to their old cuſtoms: and againe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide, ſome be ſo new fangled, that they would inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate all things, &amp; ſo deſpiſe the old, that nothing can like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but that is new: it was thought expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not ſo much to haue reſpect how to pleaſe &amp; ſatiſfie either of thefe parties as how to pleaſe God, &amp; profit them both. And yet leſt any man ſhould be offended, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good reaſon might ſatiſfie, here be certaine cauſes rendred, why ſome of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Ceremonies be put a way, and ſome reteined and kept ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Some are put a way, becauſe the great exceſſe and multitude of them hath ſo increaſed in theſe latter dayes, that the burden of them was intollerable, whereof S. Auguſtine in his time complained, that they were growen to ſuch a number, that the ſtate of Chriſtian people was in worſe caſe, concerning that matter, then were the Iewes. And he counſelled, that ſuch yoke and burden ſhould bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a way, as time would ſerue quietly to doe it.</p>
                  <p>But what would S. Auguſtine haue ſaid, if he had ſeen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of late daies vſed among vs whereunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude vſed in his time was not to be compared, This our exceſſiue multitude of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.
<pb facs="tcp:1545:7"/>
was ſo great, and many of them ſo darke, that they did more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and darken, then declare and ſet forth Chriſts benefits vnto vs</p>
                  <p>And beſides this Chriſts Goſpel is not a ceremoniall law (as much of Moſes law was) but it is a religion to ſerue Gob, not in bondage of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or ſhadow, but in the freedome of the ſpirite, being content onely with thoſe ceremonies, which doe ſerue to a decent order, and godly diſct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and ſuch as bee apt to ſtirre vp the dull minde of man to the remcm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brauce of his duety to God, by ſome notable &amp; ſpecial ſignification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he nught be edified.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the moſt waightr cauſe of the aboliſhment of certaine ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies was, that they were ſo farre abuſed partly by the ſuperſtitious blindneſſe of the rude and vnlearned, and partly by the vnſatiable auarice of ſuch as ſought more their owne lucre, then the glory of God, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes could not well be taken away, the thing remaining ſtill. But now as concerning thoſe perſons, which peraduenture wil be offended, for that ſome of the old Ceremonies, are retained ſtil: if they conſider, that without ſome Ceremonies, it is not poſſible to keepe any order, or quiet diſipline in the church, they ſhal eaſily perceiue iuſt cauſe to reforme their iudgments. And if they thinke much that nay of the old do remaine, and would rather haue all deuiſed anew: Then ſuch men granting ſome Ceremonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be had, ſurely where the old may be wel vſed, there they cannot reaſonably reprooue the olde, oncly for their age, without bewraying of their owne folly For in ſuch a caſe, they ought rather to haue reuerence vnto them for their antiquitie, if they willdeclare themſeluse to be more ſtudious of vnitie and concord, then of innouations and newfangleneſſe, which (as much as m may be, with true ſetting forth of Chriſts religion) is alwayes to bee eſchewed. Furthermore, ſuch ſhall haue no tuſt cauſe with the Ceremonies reſerved, be offended. For as thoſe be taken away which were moſt abuſed, and did burden mens conſcrences wiyhout any cauſe: ſo the other that remain are retained for a diſcipline and order, which (vponiuſt cauſes) may bee altered and changed, and therefore are not to bee eſteemed equal with Gods Law. And moreouer they be neither darke nor dumbe ceremonies, but are ſet forth, that euery man may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they doe meane, and to what vſe they doe ſerue. So that it is not like, that they in time to come, ſhould be abuſed as other haue been. And in theſe our doing we condemne no other nations nor preſcribe any thing, but to our owne people onely. For we thinke it conuenient, thate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery countrey ſhould vſe ſuch Ceremonies, as they ſhall thinke belt to the fetting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the reducing of the people to a moſt perfect and godly liuing, without errour or ſuoerſtition: And that they ſhould put a way other things, which from time to time they perceiue to be moſt abuſed, as in mens ordinances it often chanceth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly, in diuers countreys.</p>

                        <p>Perfect God, and perfect man: of a reaſonable ſoule, and humane fleſh ſubſiſting.</p>
                        <p>Equall to the Father as touching his godhead: and inferior to the Father, touching his manhood.</p>
                        <p>Who although he be God and man: yet he is not two, but one Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>One, not by converſion of the Godhead into fleſh: but by taking of the manhood into God.</p>
                        <p>One altogether, not by confuſion of ſubſtance: but by vnitie of perſon.</p>
                        <p>For as the reaſonable ſoule and fleſh is one man:ſo God and man is one Chriſt.</p>

And in that ſhee hath caſt this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on my body, ſhe did it to burie mee. Verely I ſay vnto you, Whereſoeuer this goſpel ſhal be preached in al the world, there ſhal alſo this be told that ſhe hath done, for a memorial of her. Then one of the twelue (which was called Iudas Iſcariot) went vnto the chiefe Prieſtes, and ſayd vnto them, What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you? And they appointed vnto him thirtie pieces of ſiluer. And from that time foorth, hee ſought opportunite to betray him.

And he ſaid, Goe into the citie to ſuch a man, and ſay vnto him, The maſter ſaieth, My time is at hand: I wil keepe my Eaſter by thee with my diſciples. And the diſciples did as Ieſus had appointed them, and they made readie the Paſſeouer. When the euen was come, he ſate downe with the twelue: and as they did eate, he ſayd, Verily I ſay vnto you, that one of you ſhall betray me. And they were exceeding ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and began euery one of them to ſay vnto him, Lord, is it I? He anſwered and ſaid, He that dippeth his hand with me in the diſh, the ſame ſhall betray mee. The ſonne of man truely goeth as it is written of him: but wo vnto that man by whom the ſonne of man is betrayed: it had bene good for that man if he had not bene borne. Then Iudas which betrayed him, anſwered and ſayd, Maſter, Is it I? He ſayd vnto him, Thou haſt ſayd.

Then ſaid Ieſus vnto them, All yee ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night: For it is written, I will ſmite the Sheepehearde, and the ſheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered abroad: but after I am riſen againe, I willl goe before you into Galile. Peter anſwered and ſayd vnto him, Though all men be offended becauſe of thee, yet will not I be offended.

Peter ſayd vnto him, Yea, though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewiſe alſo ſaid all the Diſciples. Then came Ieſus with them vnto a Farme place (which is called <hi>Gethſemane</hi>) and ſayd vnto the diſciples, Sit ye here while I goe and pray yonder. And he tooke with him Peter and the two ſonnes of Zebedee, and beganne to waxe ſorowfull and heauie.

And he went a litle further, and fell flat on his face, and prayed, ſaying O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me: neuertheleſſe not as I will, but as thou wilt. And he came vnto the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and found them aſleepe, and ſayd vnto Peter, What, could yee not watch with mee one houre: Watch and pray, that yee enter not into temptation: The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weake. Hee went away once againe, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup may not paſſe away from mee, except I drinke of it, thy will be fulfilled. And hee came and found them aſleepe againe, for their eyes were heauie. And he left them, and went againe, and praied the third time, ſaying the ſame words. Then commeth he to his Diſciples, and ſayd vnto them, Sleepe on now, and take your reſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is betrayed into the hands of ſinners. Riſe, let vs be going, behold, he is at hand that doeth betray me.

And behold, one of them which were with Ieſus, ſtretched out his hand, and drew his ſworde, and ſtrooke a ſeruant of hie Prieſt, and ſmote off his eare. Then ſayd Ieſus vnto him, Put vp thy ſworde into the ſheath: for all they that take the ſworde, ſhall periſh with the ſworde. Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to ny Father, and he ſhall giue me euen now more then twelue legions of Angels? But howe then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? For thus muſt it be. In that ſame houre ſayd Ieſus to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were to a thiefe, with ſwords and ſtaues for to take me. I ſate daily with you teaching in the Temple, &amp; ye tooke me not. But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfiled. Then all the diſciples forſooke him and fled. And they tooke Ieſus, and led him to Caiaphas the high Prieſt, where the Scribes &amp; the Elders were aſſembled. But Peter followed him afarre off vnto the hie Prieſts palace, and went in, and ſate with the ſeruantes, to ſee the ende. The chiefe Prieſts and Elders, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witneſſe againſt Ieſus, for to put him to death, but found none: yea, when many falſe witneſſes came, yet found they none. At the laſt came two falſe witneſſes, and ſaid, This follow ſaid I am able to deſtroy the Temple of GOD, and, to build it againe in three dayes. And the chiefe Prieſt aroſe, and ſayd vnto him, Anſwereſt thou nothing? Why doe theſe beare witneſſe againſt thee? But Ieſus held his peace. And the chiefe Prieſt anſwered, and ſayd vnto him, I charge thee by the liuing God, that thou tell vs whether thou bee Chriſt the Sonne of God. Ieſus ſayd vnto him, Thou haſt ſayde. Neuertheleſſe I ſay vnto you, Hereafter ſhall yee ſee the Sonne of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the cloudes of the ſkie. Then the high Prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying, He hath ſpoken blaſphemie, what need we of any more witneſſes? Beholde nowe yee haue heard his blaſphemie, what thinke ye? They anſwered, and ſayd, Hee

And other ſmote him on the face with the palme of their handes, ſaying, Tell vs, thou Chriſt, who is hee that ſmote thee? Peter ſate without in the Court, and a Damoſell came to him, ſaying, Thou alſo waſt with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Galilee. But hee denied before them all, ſaying, I wote not what thou ſayeſt. When he was gone out into the porch, another wench ſawe him, and ſayde vnto them that were there, This fellowe was alſo with Ieſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. And againe hee denyed with an othe, ſaying, I doe not know the man. After a while came vnto him they that ſtoode by, and ſayde vnto Peter, Surely thou art euen one of them, for thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee. Then began hee to curſe and to ſweare that he knew not the man. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the Cocke crewe.

When the morning was come, all the chiefe Prieſtes and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people held a counſell againſt Ieſus to put him to death, and brought him bound, and deliuered him vnto Pontius Pilate the Deputie. Then Iudas which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him (ſeeing that he was condemned) repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and brought againe the xxx. plates of ſiluer to the chiefe Prieſtes and Elders, ſaying, I haue ſinned, betraying the innocent blood. And they ſayd, What is that to vs? ſee thou to that. And he caſt downe the ſiluer plates in the Temple, and departed, and went and hanged himſelfe. And the chiefe Prieſtes tooke the ſiluer plates, &amp; ſaid, It is not lawful for to put them into the treaſurie, becauſe it is the price of blood. And they tooke counſaile, and bought with them a potters field to bury ſtrangers in. Wherefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field is called <hi>Acheldama,</hi> that is, The field of blood, vntil this day. Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Ieremie the Prophet, ſaying, And they tooke xxx. ſiluer plates, the price of him that was valued, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bought of the children of Iſrael, &amp; gaue them for the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters field, as the Lord appointed me.

<pb facs="tcp:1545:58"/>
he was accuſed of the chiefe, Prieſtes and Elders, hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing. Then ſayd Pilate vnto him, Heareſt thou not how many witneſſes they lay againſt thee? And hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to neuer a worde, inſomuch that the Deputie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled greatly. At that feaſt, the Deputie was woont to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure vnto people a priſoner, whom they would deſire. He had then a notable priſoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate ſayd, Whether wil ye that I giue looſe vnto you Barabbas, or Ieſus which is called Chriſt? For hee knew that for enuie they had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him. When he was ſet downe to giue iudgement, his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying, Haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man, for I haue ſuffered this day many things in my ſleepe, becauſe of him. But the chiefe Prieſtes and Elders perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people that they ſhould aſke Barabbas, and deſtroy Ieſus. The Deputie anſwered, and ſayd vnto them, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the twaine will yee that I let looſe vnto you? They ſayd, Barabbas. Pilate ſayd vnto them, What ſhall I doe then with Ieſus, which is called Chriſt? They all ſayd vnto him, Let him be crucified. The Deputie ſayde, What euill hath he done? But they cryed more, ſaying, Let him be crucified. When Pilate ſawe that hee could preuaile nothing, but that more buſineſſe was made, he tooke water, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his handes before the pepple, ſaying, I am innocent of the blood of this iuſt perſon, ſee ye. Then anſwered all the people, and ſayde, His blood be on vs and on our children. Then let hee Barabbas looſe vnto them, and ſcourged Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and deliuered him to be crucified. Then the ſouldiers of the Deputie tooke Ieſus into the common Hall, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him all the company, and they ſtripped him, and put on him a purple robe, and platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a reede in his right hand, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying, Haile King of the Iewes. And when they had ſpit vpon him, they tooke the reede, and ſmote him on the head, and after that they had mocked him, they tooke the robe off him againe, and put his owne rayment on him, and led him away to crucifie him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene
<pb facs="tcp:1545:59"/>
(named Simon) him they compelled to beare his croſſe. And the came vnto the place which is called <hi>Golgotha,</hi> (that is to ſay, a place of dead mens ſkuls) and gaue him vineger mingled with gall, to drink: and when hee had taſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he would not drinke. When they had crucified him, they parted his garments, and did caſt lots, that it might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which was ſpoken by the Prophet, They parted my garmentes among them, and vpon my veſture did they caſt lots. And they ſate and watched him there, and ſet vp ouer his head the cauſe of his death written,<hi>This is Ieſus the King of the Iewes.</hi> Then were there two thieues crucified with him, one on the right hand, &amp; the other on the left. They that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, reueiled him, wagging their heades, and ſaying, Thou that deſtroyedſt the Temple of God, and diddeſt build it in three dayes, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou be the Sonne of GOD, come downe from the croſſe. Likewiſe alſo the high Prieſts mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders, ſayd, Hee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued other, himſelfe he cannot ſaue. If he be the King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, let him now come downe from the croſſe, and wee will beleeue him.

From the ſixth houre was there darkeneſſe ouer all the land, vntil the ninth houre. And about the ninth houre Ieſus cryed with a loud voyce, ſaying,<hi>Eli, Eli, lama ſabachtha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> that is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Some of them that ſtoode there, when they heard that, ſayd, This man calleth for Elias. And ſtraightway one of them ranne, and tooke a ſpunge, and when hee had filled it full of vineger, hee put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke. Other ſayd, Let bee, let vs ſee whether Elias wil come, and deliuer him. Ieſus when he had cryed againe with a loude voyce yeelded vp the Ghoſt. And beholde, the vaile of the Temple did rent in two partes from the top to the bottome, and the earth did quake, and the ſtones rent, and graues did open, and many bodies of Saintes which ſlept, aroſe, and went out of the graues after his reſurretion, and came into the holy Citie, and appeared vnto many.

And when hee was in Bethanie, in the houſe of Simon the leper, euen as he ſate at meate, there came a woman hauing an Alabaſter boxe of cyntment, called <hi>Nard,</hi> that was pure and coſtly, and ſhee brake the boxe, and powred it vpon his head. And there were ſome that were not content within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſayd, What needed this waſt of oyntment? for it might haue bene ſolde for more then three hundred pence, and haue bene giuen to the poore: and they grudged againſt her.

Shee hath done a good worke on mee: for yee haue poore with you alwayes, and whenſoeuer yee will, yee may doe them good: but mee haue ye not alwayes. Shee hath done that ſhe could, ſhe came aforehand to annoint my body to the burying.

And Iudas Iſcariot, one of the twelue, went away vnto the high Prieſts to betray him vnto them. When they heard that, they were glad, and promiſed that they would giue him money. And hee ſought how he might conueniently betray him. And the firſt day of ſweete bread (When they offered the Paſſeouer) his diſciples ſaid vnto him, Where wilt thou that we goe &amp; prepare that thou mayeſt eate the Paſſeouer?

And when it was now euentide, he came with the twelue: and as they ſate at boord, and did eate, Ieſus ſayd, Verely I ſay vnto you, one of you (that eateth with me) ſhall betray me. And they began to be ſory, and to ſay to him one by one, Is it I: And another ſaid, Is it I: He anſwered, and ſayd vnto them, It is one of the twelue, euen he that dippeth with me in the platter. The ſonne of man truely goeth as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him: but woe vnto that man by whom the ſonne of man is betrayed: good were it for that man if he had neuer bene borne.

And when they had ſayd grace, they went out to the mount O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuet. And Ieſus ſayeth vnto them, All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of mee this night: For it is written, I will finite the ſheepeheard, and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcattered: but after that I am riſen againe, I will goe into Galilee before you.

Riſe vp, let vs goe: loe, he that betrayeth me is at hand. And immediatly while he yet ſpake, commeth Iudas (which was one of the twelue) and with him a great number of people, with ſwords and ſtaues, from the high Prieſts, and Scribes, and Elders. And he that betrayed him, had giuen them a generall token, ſaying, Whomſoeuer I doe kiſſe, the ſame is he, take and leade him away warily. And aſſoone as he was come, hee goeth ſtraight way to him, and ſayth vnto him, Maſter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and kiſſed him. And they layd their hands on him, and tooke him. And one of them that ſtoode by drew out a ſword, and ſmote a ſeruant of the high Prieſtes, and cut off his eare. And Ieſus anſwered and ſayd vnto them, Yee bee come out as vnto a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues, for to take mee: I was dayly with you in the Temple teaching, and yee tooke me not: But theſe things come to paſſe, that the Scriptures ſhould be fulfilled. And they all forſooke him, and ranne away. And there followed him a certaine yoong man clothed in linnen vpon the bare, and the yoong men caught him, and he left his linnen garment, and fledde from them naked. And they led Ieſus away to the high Prieſt of all, and with him came all the high Prieſts, and the Eldres, and the Scribes. And Peter followed him a great way off (euen till hee was come into the palace of the high Prieſt)
<pb facs="tcp:1545:62"/>
and hee ſate with the ſeruants, and warmed himſelfe at the fire. And the hie Prieſts and all the counſaile ſought for witneſſe againtſt Ieſus to put him to death, and found none: for many bare falſe witneſſe againſt him, but their witneſſes agreed not together. And there aroſe certaine, and brought falſe witneſſe againſt him, ſaying, We heard ſay, I will deſtroy this Temple that is made with handes, and within three dayes I will build another made without hande: But yet their witneſſes agreed not together. And the high Prieſt ſtoode vp among them, and aſked Ieſus, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou nothing? Howe is it that theſe beare witneſſe againſt thee: But he held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the hie Prieſt aſked him, and ſaid vnto him, Art thou Chriſt the ſonne of the Bleſſed: And Ieſus ſaid, I am: and ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and comming in the cloudes of heauen. Then the hie Prieſt rent his clothes, and ſaid, What need wee any further witneſſes? yee haue heard blaſphemie, what thinke yee? And they all condemned him to be woorthy of death. And ſome began to ſpit at him, and to couer his face, and to beate him with fiſts, and to ſay vnto him, Aread. And the ſeruants buffeted him on the face. And as Peter was be neath in the palace, there came one of the wenches of the hie Prieſt, and when ſhe ſaw Peter warming himſelfe, ſhe looked on him, and ſayd, Waſt not thou alſo with Ieſus of Nazareth?

Then entred Satan into Iudas, whoſe ſurname was Iſcariot, which was of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the twelue, and he went his way, and communed with the hie prieſts and officers, how he might betray him vnto them. And they were glad, and promiſed to giue him money. And hee conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſought opportunitie to betray him vnto them, when the people were away. Then came the day of ſweete bread, when of neceſſitie the Paſſeouer muſt be offered. And he ſent Peter and Iohn, ſaying, Goe and prepare vs the Paſſeouer, that we may eate. They ſayde vnto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? And hee ſayde vnto them, Behold, when yee enter into the Citie, there ſhall a man meete you, bearing a pitcher of water, him follow into the ſame houſe that hee entereth in, and yee ſhall ſay vnto the goodman of the houſe, The maſter ſayeth vnto thee, Where is the gheſt chamber, where I ſhall eate the Paſſeouer with my Diſciples?

For I ſay vnto you, hencefoorth will I not eate of it any more, vntill it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the kingdome of God. And hee tooke the cup, and gaue thanks, and ſayd.

vntill the kingdome of God come. And hee tooke bread, and when he had giuen thanks, he brake it, and gaue it vnto them, ſaying, This is my body which is giuen for you: this doe in the remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo when he had ſupped, hee tooke the cup, ſaying, This cup is the newe Teſtament in my blood, which is ſhed for you. Yet beholde, the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table. And truely the Sonne of man goeth as it is appointed: but woe vnto that man by whom hee is betrayed. And they began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire among themſelues, which of them it was that ſhould doe it. And there was a ſtrife among them, which of them ſhould ſeeme to bee the greateſt. And hee ſayde vnto them, The kings of nations reigne ouer them, and they that haue anthoritie vpon them, are called gracious: but ye ſhall not ſo be. But hee that is greateſt among you, ſhall bee as the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and he that is chiefe, ſhall be as hee that doth miniſter.

And I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my father hath appointed to mee, that yee may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and ſit on ſeates iudging the twelue tribes of Iſrael. And the Lord ſayde, Simon, Simon, beholde, Satan hath deſired to ſift you, as it were wheate: but I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. And when thou art conuerted, ſtrengthen thy brethren. And he ſaid vnto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee into priſon, and to death. And he ſayd, I tell thee Peter, the Cocke ſhal not crowe this day, till thou haue denied thriſe that thou knoweſt me. And he ſayd vnto them, When I ſent you without wallet, &amp; ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked you any thing? And they ſayd, No. Then ſayd he vnto them, But now he that hath a wallet, let him take it vp, and likewiſe his ſcrip, and he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his coate and buy one. For I ſay vnto you, that yet the ſame which is written, muſt be performed in me, Euen among the wicked was hee repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for thoſe things which are written of mee, haue an ende. And they ſayde, Lorde, beholde, here are two ſwordes.
<pb facs="tcp:1545:65"/>
And hee ſayd vnto them, It is enough. And he came out, and went (as hee was woont) to mount Oliuet. And the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples followed him: and when hee came to the place, hee ſayd vnto them, Pray, left ye fall into temptation. And hee gate himſelfe from them about a ſtones caſt, and kneeled downe, and prayed, ſaying, Father, if thou wilt, remooue this cup from mee: neuertheleſſe, not my will, but thine be fulfilled. And there appeared an Angel vnto him from heauen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting him. And hee was in an agonie, and prayed the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his ſweate was like droppes of blood, trickling downe to the ground. And when hee aroſe from prayer, and was come to his diſciples, hee found them ſleeping for heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and he ſayd vnto them, Why ſleepe ye? Riſe, and pray, left yee fall into temptation. While he yet ſpake, behold, there came a company and he that was called Iudas, oue of the twelue, went before them, and preaſſed nigh vnto Ieſus to kiſſe him. But Ieſus ſayd vnto him, Iudas, betrayeſt thou the ſonne of man with a kiſſe? When they which were about him, ſawe what would follow, they ſayde vnto him, Lorde, ſhall we ſmite with the ſword? And one of them ſmote a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the high Prieſts, and ſtrooke off his right eare. Ieſus anſwered, and ſayd, Suffer ye thus farre foorth. And when he touched his eare, he healed him. Then Ieſus ſayd vnto the high Prieſtes and Rulers of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him. Yee be come out as vnto a thiefe, with ſwordes and ſtaues. When I was daily with you in the Temple, yee ſtretched foorth no hands againſt mee: But this is euen your very houre, and the power of darkeneſſe. Then tooke they him, and led him, and brought him to the high Prieſtes houſe. But Peter followed a farre off. And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the palace, and were ſet downe together, Peter alſo ſate downe among them. But when one of the wenches beheld him, as he ſate by the fire, and looked vpon him, ſhe ſaid, This ſame fellow was alſo with him. And he denied him, ſaying, Woman, I know him not. And after a little while, another ſaw him, and ſayd, Thou art alſo of them. And Peter ſayde, Man, I am not. And about the ſpace of an houre after, another affirmed,
<pb facs="tcp:1545:66"/>
ſaying, Verily this fellow was with him alſo, for he is of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee. And Peter ſaid, Man, I wot not what thou ſayeſt. And immediately while hee yet ſpake, the Cocke crewe. And the Lorde turned backe and looked vpon Peter, and Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the word of the Lord, how hee had ſayd vnto him, Before the Cocke crow, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe: And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. And the men that tooke Ieſus, mocked him, and ſmote him: And when they had blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, they ſtrooke him on the face, and aſked him, ſaying Areede, who is he that ſmote thee? And many other things deſpitefully ſaid they againſt him. And aſſoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, and the high Prieſtes, and Scribes came together, ahd led him into their councill, ſaying, Art thou very Chriſt? Tell vs. And he ſayd vnto them, If I tell you, yee will not beleeue me: and if I aſke you, you will not anſwere, nor let me goe. Hereafter ſhall the ſonne of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God. Then ſayd they all, Art thou then the ſonne of God? He ſayd, Ye ſay that I am. And they ſaid, What need we of any further witneſſe? for we our ſelues haue heard of his owne mouth.</p>

When Pilate heard mention of Galilee, hee aſked whether the man were of Galilee. And aſſoone as he knew that hee belonged vnto Herods Iuriſdiction, he ſent him to Herode, which was alſo at Hieruſalem at that time.

And there followed him a great companie of people, and of women, which bewailed and lamented him. But Ieſus turned backe vnto them, and ſayde, Yee daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not for me, but weepe for your ſelues, and for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For behold, the dayes will come, in the which they ſhall ſay, Happie are the barren, and the wombes that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue ſucke.

And after that they were come to the place, which is called <hi>Caluarie,</hi> there they crucified him, and the euill doers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then ſaid Ieſus, Father, forgiue them, for they wot not what they doe. And they parted his rayment, and caſt lots: and the people ſtoode and beheld. And the Rulers mocked him with them, ſaying, He ſaued other men, let him ſaue himſelfe, if he be verie Chriſt the choſen of God. The ſouldiers alſo mocked him, and came and offered him vineger, and ſaid, If thou bee the King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe. And a ſuperſcription was written ouer him with letters of Greeke, and Latine, and Hebrewe,<hi>This is the King of the Iewes.</hi> And one of the euill doers which were hanged, rayled on him, ſaying, If thou bee Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe and vs. But the other anſwered, and rebuked him, ſaying, Feareſt not thou GOD, ſeeing thou art in the ſame damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

<pb facs="tcp:1545:70"/>
What I ſaide vnto them: Beholde, they can tell what I ſaid. When hee had thus ſpoken, one of the miniſters which ſtoode by, ſmote Ieſus on the face, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo? Ieſus anſwered him, If I haue euill ſpoken, beare witneſſe of the euill: but if I haue well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, why ſmiteſt thou mee? And Annas ſent him bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Caiaphas the high Prieſt. Simon Peter ſtoode and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe. Then ſayde they vnto him, Art not thou alſo one of his Diſciples? Hee denied it, and ſayd, I am not. One of the ſeruants of the high Prieſt (his couſin whoſe eare Peter ſmote off) ſaide vnto him, Did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? Peter therefore denied againe, and immediately the Cocke crewe. Then led they Ieſus from Caiaphas, into the hall of iudgement: It was in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and they themſelues went not into the iudgement hall, leaſt they ſhould bee defiled, but that they might eate the Paſſeouer. Pilate then went out to them, and ſayde, What accuſation bring you againſt this man? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſayd vnto him, If he were not an euill doer, we would not haue deliuered him vnto thee. Then ſayde Pilate vnto them, Take yee him, and iudge him after your owne lawe. The Iewes therefore ſayd vnto him, It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to put any man to death: that the wordes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus might bee fulfilled which he ſpake, ſignifying what death hee ſhould die. Then Pilate entred into the iudgement hall againe, and called Ieſus, and ſayde vnto him, Art thou the King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered, Sayeſt thou that of thy ſelfe, or did other tell it thee of me? Pilate anſwered, Am I a Iewe? Thine owne nation, and high Prieſtes haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered thee vnto me: what haſt thou done? Ieſus anſwered, My kingdome is not of this world. If my kingdome were of this world, then would my miniſters ſurely fight, that I ſhould not bee deliuered to the Iewes: but now is my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome not from hence. Pilate therefore ſayde vnto him, Art thou a king then? Ieſus anſwered, Thou ſayeſt that I am a king. For this cauſe was I borne, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould be are witneſſe vnto the trueth: And all that are of the trueth, heare my voyce. Pilate ſayd
<pb facs="tcp:1545:70"/>
vnto him, What thing is trueth? And when hee had ſayde this, hee went out againe vnto the Iewes, and ſayde vnto them, I find in him no cauſe at all. Yee haue a cuſtome that I ſhould deliuer you one looſe at Eaſter: will ye that I looſe vnto you the king of the Iewes: Then cried they all againe, ſaying, Not him, but Barabbas: The ſame Barabbas was a murderer, Then Pilate tooke Ieſus therefore, and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him: and the ſouldiers wound a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head. And they did on him a purple garment, and came vnto him, and ſayde, Haile King of the Iewes: and they ſmote him on the face. Pilate went foorth againe and ſayde vnto them, Behold, I bring him foorth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. Then came Ieſus forth, wearing a crowne of thorne, and a robe of purple. And he ſayth vnto them, Behold the man. When the high Prieſts therefore and the miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, Crucifie him, crucifie him. Pilate ſayeth vnto them, Take yee him, and crucifie him. for I finde no cauſe in him. The Iewes anſwered him, Wee haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God. When Pilate heard that ſaying; hee was the more afrayd, and went againe into the Iudgement hall, and ſayd vnto Ieſus, Whence art thou? But Ieſus gaue him none anſwere. Then ſayd Pilate vnto him, Speakeſt thou not vnto mee? Knoweſt thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to looſe thee? Ieſus anſwered, Thou couldeſt haue no power at all againſt me, except it were giuen thee from aboue. Therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the more ſinne. And from thencefoorth ſought Pilate meanes to looſe him. But the Iewes cried, ſaying, If thou let him goe, thou art not Ceſars friend: for whoſoeuer maketh himſelfe a King, is againſt Ceſar. When Pilate heard that ſaying, hee brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate downe to giue ſentence, in a place that is called the pauement, but in the Hebrewe tongue,<hi>Gabbatha.</hi> It was the preparing day of Eaſter, about the ſixt houre. And hee ſayeth vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King. They cryed, ſaying, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate ſayeth
<pb facs="tcp:1545:71"/>
vnto them, Shall I crucifie your king? The high Prieſtes anſwered, We haue no king but Ceaſar. Then deliuered. he him to them to bee crucified. And they tooke Ieſus, and led him away. And he bare his croſſe, and went forth into a place which is called the place of dead mens ſkuls, but in Hebrewe <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either ſide one, and Ieſus in the middeſt. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it vpon the croſſe. The writing was, <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth, King of the Iewes.</hi> This title read many of the Iewes: for the place where Ieſus was crucified, was neere to the citie. And it was written in Hebrew, Greeke, and Latin. Then ſaid the high prieſtes of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, King of the Iewes: but that he ſaid, I am king of the Iewes. Pilate anſwered, What I haue written, that I haue written. Then the ſouldiers, when they had crucified Ieſus, tooke his garments, and made foure partes, to euery ſouldiers a part, and alſo his coate. The coate was without ſeame, wrought vpon throughout. They ſayd therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, Let vs not diuide it, but caſt lots for it, who ſhall haue it, that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, They haue parted my rayment among them, and for my coate did they caſt lots. And the ſouldiers did ſuch things in deede. There ſtoode by the croſſe of Ieſus his mother, and his mothers ſiſter, Marie the wife of Cleophas, and Marie Magdalene. When Ieſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the diſciple whome he loued ſtanding, hee ſaieth vnto his mother, Woman, behold thy ſonne. Then ſayd he to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Bhold mother. And from that houre, the diſciple tooke her for his owne. After theſe things, Ieſus knowing that all things were nowe performed, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might bee fulfilled, he ſayeth, I thirſt. So there ſtood a veſſell by, full of vineger: therefore they filled a ſpunge with vineger, and wound it about with hyſope, and put it to his mouth. Aſſoone as Ieſus then receiued the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, hee ſayde, It is finiſhed, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghoſt. The Iewes therefore, becauſe it was the preparing of the Sabboth, that the bodies ſhould not remaine vpon the croſſe on the Sabboth day (for that
<pb facs="tcp:1545:71"/>
Sabbath day was an high day) beſought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken downe. Then came the ſouldiers, and brake the legs of the firſt, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe that hee was dead alreadie, they brake not his legs: but one of the ſouldiers with a ſpeare thruſt him into the ſide, and foorthwith there came out blood and water. And he that ſaw it, bare record, and his record is true. And he knoweth that he ſayeth true, that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue alſo. For theſe things were done, that the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled, Ye ſhall not breake a bone of him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine another Scripture ſaieth, They ſhall looke vpon him whom they haue pearced. After this, Ioſeph of Arumathea (which was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecretly for feare of the Iewes) beſought Pilate that he might take downe the body of Ieſus. And Pilate gaue him licence. He came therefore and tooke the bodie of Ieſus. And there came alſo Nicodemus (which at the beginning came to Ieſus by night) &amp; brought of myrrhe and aloes mingled together, about an hundreth pound weight. Then tooke they the bodie of Ieſus, and wound it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie. And in the place where he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied there was agarden, and in the garden a newe ſepulchre, wherein was neuer man laid. There laid they Ieſus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe of the preparing of the Sabboth of the Iewes, for the ſepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>

And when they found no cauſe of death in him, yet deſired they Pilat to kill him. And when they had fulfilled all that were written of him, they tooke him downe from the tree, and put him in a ſepulchre. But God raiſed him againe from death the third day, and he was ſeene many dayes of them which went with him from Galilee to Hieruſalem, which are witneſſes vnto the people. And wee declare vnto you, how that the promiſe which was made vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, God hath fulfilled vnto their children, euen vnto vs, in that he raiſed vp Ieſus againe, euen as it is written in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pſalme, Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee. As concerning that he raiſed him vp from death, now no more to returne to corruption, hee ſayd on this wife. The holy promiſes made to Dauid, will I giue faithfully vnto you. Wherefore hee ſayeth alſo in another place, Thou ſhall not ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption. For Dauid (after that he had in his time fulfilled the will of God) fell on ſleepe, and was laid vnto his fathers, and ſaw corruption. But hee whom God raiſed againe ſaw no corruption. Be it knowen vnto you therefore (yee men and brethren) that through this man is preached vnto you forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and that by him all that beleeue, are iuſtified from all things, from which ye could not be iuſtified by the law of Moſes. Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leſt that fall on you, which is ſpoken of in the Prophets, Behold yee deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh ye: For I doe a worke in your dayes, which yee ſhall not beleeue, though a man declare it vnto you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1545:140"/>
Saint Paul in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians the fift Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doeth giue this commandement to all married men, Yee huſbands, loue your wiues, euen as Chriſt loued the Church, and hath giuen himſelfe for it, to ſanctfie it, purging it in the fountaine of water, through the worde, that he might make it vnto himſelfe a glorious congregation, not hauing ſpot or wrinckle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould bee holy and blameleſſe. So men are bound to loue their owne wiues, as their owne bodies. He that loueth his owne wife, loueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: For neuer did any man hate his owne fleſh, but nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord doeth the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue father &amp; mother, and ſhall be ioyned vnto his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This myſterie is great: but I ſpeake of Chriſt, and of the congregation. Neuertheleſſe, let euery one of you ſo loue his owne wife euen as himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Like wiſe ſame Saint Paul writing to the Coloſſians, <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.</note> ſpeaketh thus to all men that be married, Ye men loue your wiues, and be not bitter vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Heare alſo what S.Peter the Apoſtle of Chriſt, <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> which was himſelfe a maried man, ſayed vnto all men that are maried, Yee huſbands, dwell with your wiues according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, giuing honor vnto the wife, as vnto the weaker veſſel, and as heires together of the grace of life, ſo that your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be not hindred.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto yee haue heard the duetie of the hunſband toword the wife. Now likewife ye wiues, heare and learne your due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards your huſbands, euen as it is plainely ſet foorth in holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Saint Paul, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> in the forenamed Epiſtle to the Epheſians, teacheth you thus: Ye women, ſubmit your ſelues vnto your owne huſbands, as vnto the Lord. For the huſband is the wiues head, euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church, and hee is alſo the Sauiour of the whole body.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as the Church or Congregation is ſubiect vnto Chriſt, So likewiſe let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiues alſo be in ſubietion vnto their owne hubands in all things. And againe hee ſayth, Let the
<pb facs="tcp:1545:140"/>
wife reuerence her huſband. And in his Epiſtle to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, S.Paul giueth you this ſhort leſſon, Ye wiues, ſubmit your ſelues vnto your owne huſbands, as it is conuenient in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Saint Peter alſo doth inſtruct you very godly, thus ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let wiues be ſubiect to their owne huſbandes, ſo that if any obey not the worde, they may bee wonne without the worde, by the conuerſation of the wiues, while they beholde your chaſte conuerſation coupled with feare. Whole apparell let it not bee outward, with broyded haire, and trimming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with golde, either in putting on of gorgeous apparell: but let the hid man which is in the heart, bee without all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſo that the ſpirite be milde and quiet, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing in the ſight of God. For after this maner in the olde time did the holy women, which truſted in God, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell themſelues, being ſubiect to their owne huſbandes: as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whoſe daughters yee are made doing well, and not being diſmayed with any feare.</p>

Wherefore, whatſoeuer your ſikeneſſe is, know you certainely that it is Gods viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for what cauſe ſo euer this ſickneſſe is ſent vnto you, whether it be to try your patience for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of other, and that your faith may bee found in the day of the Lord, laudable, glorious, &amp; honourable, to the increaſe of glory and endleſſe felicitie, or els it be ſent vnto you to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and amend in you whatſoeuer doeth offend the eyes of your heauenly Father: know you certainly, that if you truely repent you of your ſinnes, and beare your ſickneſſe patiently, truſting in Gods mercy, for his deare Sonne Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, and render vnto him humble thankes for his fatherly viſitation, ſubmitting your ſelfe wholly vnto his will, it ſhall turne to your profite, and helpe you foward in the right way thatleadeth vnto life euerlaſting.</p>

                     <hi>If the perſon viſited be very ſicke, then the Curate may ende his ex hortation in this place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take therefore in good woorth the chaſtiſement of the Lorde. For whom the Lorde loueth, hee chaſtiſeth: yea, as Saint Paul ſaith, he ſcourgeth euery ſonne which hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. If ye endure thaſtiſement, he offreth himſelf vnto you, as vnto his owne children. What ſonne is he that the father chaſtiſeth not? If ye be not vnder correction, where of all true children children are partakers, then are yee baſtards, &amp; not children. Therfore ſeeing that when our carnall fathers do correct vs, we reuerently obey them: ſhall we not now much rather be obedient to our ſpirituall Father, &amp; ſo liue? And they for a few
<pb facs="tcp:1545:142"/>
dayes doe chaſtiſe vs after their owne pleaſure: but he doeth chaſtiſe vs for our profite, to the intent hee may make vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holines. These words (good brother) are Gods wordes, and written in holy Scripture for our comfort and inſtruction, that wee ſhould patiently and with thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beare our heauenly Fathers correction, whenſoeuer by any maner of aduerſitie it ſhall pleaſe his gracious goodneſſe to viſite vs. And there ſhould be no greater comfort to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perſons, then to bee made like vnto Chriſt, by ſuffering patiently aduerſities, troubles, &amp; ſickeneſſes. For he himſelfe went not vp to ioy, but firſt hee ſuffered paine, he entred not into his glory, before he was crucified. So truely our way to eternall ioy is, to ſuffer here with Chriſt, and our doore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into eternall life is, gladly to die with Chriſt, that we may riſe againe from death, and dwel with him in euerlaſting life. Now therefore taking your ſickeneſſe, which is thus profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you, patiently, I exhort you in the name of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the profeſſion which you made vnto God in your baptiſme. And foraſmuch as after this life, there is a count to be giuen vnto the righteous Iudge, of whom all muſt bee iudged without reſpect of perſons: I require you to examine your ſelfe, and your ſtate, both toward God and man, ſo that accuſing and condemning your ſelfe for your own faults, you may finde mercy at our heauenly Fathers hand for Chriſtes ſake, and not to bee accuſed and condemned in that fearefull iudgement. Therefore I ſhall ſhortly rehearſe the Articles of our faith, that you may know whether you doe beleeue as a Chriſtian man ſhould, or no.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſt is riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruites of them that ſleepe. For by a man came death, and by a man came the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead. For as by Adam all die, euen ſo by Chriſt ſhall all bee made aliue, but euery man in his owne order. The firſt is Chriſt, then they that are Chriſtes at his comming. Then commeth the ende, when hee hath deliuered vp the kingdome to God the Father, when he hath put downe all rule, and all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power. For he muſt reigne till he haue put al his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnder his feete. The laſt enemie that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death. For hee hath put all things vnder his feete. But
<pb facs="tcp:1545:146"/>
when hee ſaith, All things are put vnder him: it is manifeſt that he is excepted that hath put all things vnder him. When all things are ſubdued vnto him, then ſhall the Sonne alſo himſelfe bee ſubject vnto him that put all things vnder him, that God may be all in all. Elſe what doe they which are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ouer the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? Why are they then baptized ouer them? yea, and why ſtand we alway then in ieopardie? By our reioycing which I haue in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord, I die dayly. That I haue fought with beaſtes at Epheſus after the maner of men, what aduantageth it mee, if the dead riſe not againe? Let vs eate, and drinke, for tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wee ſhall die. Bee not yee deceiued, euill words corrupt good maners. Awake truely out of ſleepe, and ſinne not. For ſome haue not the knowledge of God, I ſpeake this to your ſhame. But ſome man will ſay, How ariſe the dead? With what body ſhall they come? Thou foole, that which thou ſoweſt, is not quickened except it die. And what ſoweſt thou? Thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall bee, but bare corne, as of wheat or ſome other: but God giueth it a body at his pleaſure, to euery ſeed his owne body. All fleſh is not one maner of fleſh: but there is one maner of fleſh of men, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of fleſh of beaſtes, another of fiſhes, another of birdes. There are alſo celeſtiall bodies, and there are bodies terreſtriall. But the glorie of the celeſtiall is one, and the glory of the terreſtrial is another. There is one maner glorie of the Sunne, and another glorie of the Moone, and another glorie of the Starres. For one Starre differeth from another in glorie. So is the reſurrection of the dead. It is ſowen in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it riſeth againe in incorruption. It is ſowen in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it riſeth againe in honour. It is ſowen in weakneſſe, it riſeth againe in power. It is ſowen a naturall bodie, it riſeth againe a ſpirituall body. There is a naturall bodie, and there is a ſpirituall bodie: As it is alſo written, The firſt man A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was made a liuing ſoule, and the laſt Adam was made a quickening ſpirite. Howbeit, that is not firſt which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, but that which is naturall, and then that which is ſpirituall. The firſt man is of the earth, earthie. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man is the Lord from heauen, heauenly. As is the
<pb facs="tcp:1545:146"/>
earthie, ſuch are they that be earthy. And as is the heauenly, ſuch are they that are heauenly. And as wee haue borne the image of the earthie, ſo ſhall wee beare the image of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly. This ſay I brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite the kingdome of God, neither doeth corruption inherite incorruption. Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery, we ſhal not all ſleepe: but we ſhall all be changed, and that in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, by the laſt trumpe. For the trumpe ſhall blow, and the dead ſhall rife incorruptible, and we ſhall bee changed: For this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortality. When this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible hath put on incorruption, and this mortall hath put on immortalitie, then ſhall be brougt to paſſe the ſaying that is written: Death is ſwallowed vp into victory: Death, where is thy ſting? Hell, where is thy victorie? The ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the law. But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore my deare brethren, bee yee ſtedfaſt and vnmooueable, alwayes rich in the worke of the Lorde, foraſmuch as yee know how that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord.</p>
